Csrf support is enabled BUT you have to execute localhost:800/admin to get the cookie.  you don't need to do the
admin login, just bring the page up.  when using curl, do the same thing with
    curl -L -c cookie.txt  http://localhost:8000/admin
and pull the value from cookie.txt.

Invoking http://localhost:8000/invmgmt/container/1 won't do the trick.  must have something to do with
rendering the admin page.  Note that unless you zap the cookie from the browser, it has a lifetime of
1 year, so you don't have to invoke the admin page every time.

Screw CSRF.  It makes sense for public facing apps, but not rest apis since they would almost NEVER be
publically accessible.  Anyway, it does not give you the kind of security you probably want: reader,
writer, admin.  SOOOOOOOOOOOO, it's disabled.

There's an example of accessing data from multiple dbs at the end of the models module.  there is a second db
setup with 5 "characteristics" - integer values mimicking attributes in RDSS, based on reagent name.
