Inventory Management client implemented in Java FX.  A bit of an olde technology, but still pretty cool.

Main difference (in functionality) from the other clients is the ability to bulk set the values in the query table for the pick list.  Done to simplify testing as Dr. Bobby found the constant hand entering of more than a few rows a major pain in the a$$.
